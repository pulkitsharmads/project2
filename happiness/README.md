# Dataset Analysis Narrative

## 1. Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 2,363 rows and 11 columns, gathering data on various aspects related to well-being across 165 countries from the years 2005 to 2023. The attributes include indicators such as the Life Ladder, Log GDP per capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth, Freedom to Make Life Choices, Generosity, Perceptions of Corruption, and measures of Positive and Negative Affects.

## 2. Analyses Performed

To better understand the dataset, we conducted the following analyses:

- **Missing Values Inspection**: A heatmap was generated (found in `analysis_missing_values.png`) to visualize the distribution of missing values across the different columns. This assisted in identifying which variables have significant gaps that may impact further analysis.

- **Summary Statistics**: We computed summary statistics for continuous variables to ascertain their distribution, measures of central tendency, and spread. Key statistics such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum were extracted for essential columns.

- **Pairplot Analysis**: A pairplot (available in `analysis_pairplot.png`) was utilized to explore relationships and distributions between different variables. This visualization helped identify potential patterns and correlations.

- **Correlation Heatmap**: A correlation heatmap (shown in `analysis_correlation.png`) was created to assess the strength and direction of relationships between numerical features. It allowed for quick identification of variables that are positively or negatively correlated with each other.

## 3. Key Insights

- **Missing Values**: The inspection of missing values revealed that several columns contained significant gaps: 
  - `Generosity` had the highest missing values (81), followed by `Perceptions of corruption` (125), and `Healthy life expectancy at birth` (63). The implications of these missing values can affect the integrity of any analyses or models produced from the dataset.

- **Life Ladder Trends**: The mean score for the Life Ladder is approximately 5.48, which suggests a moderate level of well-being across the sampled countries. However, the diversity indicated by its standard deviation of 1.12 shows pronounced variability in perceived life satisfaction.

- **Correlation Findings**: The correlation heatmap illustrated strong positive correlations between `Log GDP per capita` and `Life Ladder` (r ≈ 0.69), indicating that wealthier countries tend to report higher levels of life satisfaction. Conversely, negative affect was negatively correlated with life ladder scores, reflecting that higher negative affect is associated with lower life satisfaction.

- **Social Support's Significance**: The analysis also indicated that `Social Support` had a strong positive correlation with `Life Ladder` (r ≈ 0.62), emphasizing its potential importance in determining well-being.

## 4. Implications and Next Steps

The insights derived from this analysis underline the critical role of economic and social factors in influencing well-being. The notable correlations point towards areas where interventions could be beneficial, particularly in enhancing social support systems and addressing economic disparities.

Next steps may include:

- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing the missing data before conducting further analysis or building predictive models. This could involve imputation techniques or decision-making about exclusion based on the extent and impact of missing data.

- **Deeper Statistical Analysis**: Conducting regression analyses to quantify the influence of various factors on life satisfaction could provide more rigorous insights.

- **Policy Recommendations**: Based on the findings, policymakers can be guided to focus on improving economic conditions and social infrastructure to boost overall life satisfaction in lower-scoring countries.

These steps will help build a more comprehensive understanding of well-being factors across different countries and contribute to effective interventions aimed at enhancing human welfare.
